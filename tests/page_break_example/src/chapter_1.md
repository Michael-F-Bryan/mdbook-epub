That is text before page break.

Important note, your e-book reader must support page breaks. For example,
page breaks are supported by the Calibre e-book reader version 7.0 or later. But they are not supported in the XReader
4.0 program (Linux).

The same applies to e-book readers on electronic books.

And here's a page break....

<div class="page-break"></div>

That text should appear on next page after page break.
